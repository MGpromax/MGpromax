### Hey, I'm Manoj

I work at the intersection of **security** and **AI** — breaking systems, measuring models, and building tools that do both.

#### What I do

- **LLM Evaluation** — red-teaming, benchmark engineering, edge-case discovery
- **Security Research** — network analysis, traffic inspection, linux internals
- **Automation** — if it's repetitive, I'll script it

#### Tech

`Python` `Bash` `Linux` `Docker` `Git`
